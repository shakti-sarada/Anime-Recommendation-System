## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### 1. Download the Anime Dataset 📥

Start by downloading the latest anime dataset from Kaggle:

- Go to [Kaggle Anime Dataset 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/junaidk0012/anime-dataset-2024) and download the dataset as a `.csv` file.
- Create a folder called `data` in the root of your project directory.
- Move the `.csv` file into the `data` folder.

### 2. Preprocess the Data 🔄

The next step is to preprocess the dataset and generate the recommendation model artifacts:

- Open the Jupyter notebook file `preprocess.ipynb`.
- Run all the cells to preprocess the data and create `.pkl` files.
- Create an `artifacts` folder in your project directory.
- Save the generated `.pkl` files in the `artifacts` folder.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

Here's what your project directory should look like:

```bash
Anime-Recommendation-System/
│
├── data/
│   └── anime_dataset.csv         # Kaggle dataset file
│
├── artifacts/
│   └── *.pkl                     # Pickle files (generated by the notebook)
│
├── app.py                        # Streamlit app
├── requirements.txt              # Required Python libraries
└── preprocess.ipynb              # Preprocessing notebook
```

---

## 💡 Troubleshooting

- **Python Version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.8+.
- **Missing Libraries**: Make sure all dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **File Structure**: Double-check the paths of `data` and `artifacts` folders to ensure files are in the right place.
