# 🌸 Anime Recommendation System 🎌

Welcome to the **Anime Recommendation System**! This project helps you discover new anime based on your preferences, using a robust recommendation engine and a clean, user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Personalized Recommendations** based on anime attributes.
- Clean and **interactive user interface** powered by Streamlit.
- Preprocessed dataset with **optimized performance**.
- Easy setup with a few simple steps!

---

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### 1. Download the Anime Dataset 📥

Start by downloading the latest anime dataset from Kaggle:

- Go to [Kaggle Anime Dataset 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/junaidk0012/anime-dataset-2024) and download the dataset as a `.csv` file.
- Create a folder called `data` in the root of your project directory.
- Move the `.csv` file into the `data` folder.

---

### 2. Preprocess the Data 🔄

The next step is to preprocess the dataset and generate the recommendation model artifacts:

- Open the Jupyter notebook file `Anime Recommender System.ipynb`.
- Run all the cells to preprocess the data and create `.pkl` files.
- Create an `artifacts` folder in your project directory.
- Save the generated `.pkl` files in the `artifacts` folder.

### 3. Install Dependencies 📦

Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run this command to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Run the App 🚀

Now, you’re ready to launch the Anime Recommendation System:

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the Streamlit app using this command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Once the server starts, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view and use the app!

## 🛠️ Project Structure

Here's what your project directory should look like:

```bash
Anime-Recommendation-System/
│
├── data/
│   └── anime_dataset.csv         # Kaggle dataset file
│
├── artifacts/
│   └── *.pkl                     # Pickle files (generated by the notebook)
│
├── app.py                        # Streamlit app
├── requirements.txt              # Required Python libraries
└── preprocess.ipynb              # Preprocessing notebook
```

---

## 💡 Troubleshooting

- **Python Version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.8+.
- **Missing Libraries**: Make sure all dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **File Structure**: Double-check the paths of `data` and `artifacts` folders to ensure files are in the right place.
